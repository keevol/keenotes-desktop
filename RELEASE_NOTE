# Release Note

1. add setting of custom font for note card;
2. make progress bar transparent;
3. deprecate card height setting when switch card control from TextArea to Label;
4. double-click note card will copy note content to clipboard for sharing to chat or somewhere;
5. add share button for future extensions;
6. since note count will not be so big to fit in the memory, we cut loose the note count for display, but you can control the minimal count via setting;
